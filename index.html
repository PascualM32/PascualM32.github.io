            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>For this project, I have chosen to investigate the socio-environmental impacts of the U.S.-Mexico border. The U.S.-Mexico border 
            was first established in 1819 by the Adams–Onís Treaty between the U.S. and Spain. The border was reaffirmed in the 1828 Treaty of Limits 
            after Mexico gained its independence from Spain. The first barrier built by the U.S. was a barbed wire fence to prevent the movement of 
            cattle across the border. It was built in Ambos Nogales between 1909 and 1911 and was expanded in 1929 with a “six–foot–high chain-link fence.”</p>

            <h2>Social, Economic, and Enviornmental Impacts </h2>
            <p>Nowadays, the border is heavily patrolled and the 1,954-mile-long border has some type of barrier along 654 miles. Currently, there are varying sorts of barriers 
                along the border like a picket fence, concrete levee wall with steel bollards, floating fences, steel bollards, vehicle bollards, and “Normandy” barriers. The border 
                is a site that is enveloped with immense political, environmental, and social issues. For example, socially and politically, the topic of immigration is heavily 
                intertwined with the border. Its main job is to limit the movement of bodies. Immigration policy in the U.S. is incredibly strict and it dehumanizes bodies who attempt 
                to enter the U.S. “illegally”. The border also limits the movement of several non-human species, disrupting their migration patterns. The border also cuts through sensitive 
                ecosystems, destroys thousands of acres of habitat, impedes the cross-border migration of dozens of animal species, and causes catastrophic flooding. The border’s effects socially and environmentally are intertwined in several ways, illustrating the border’s history as a product of racism, capitalism, and American imperialism.</p>
